1. None of the examples from the I something you method would work. The way that it was set up before was that there was a static statement that you would look for within the string to determine what you say, but now you have resposnses that are variable and could have a different length, so now you have to look at the words before and after words that are variable. The way that certain phrases are found such as "I something you", have to be changed to include a search originally for the word, a blocking of he word in the middle and then a search for a word at the end.
